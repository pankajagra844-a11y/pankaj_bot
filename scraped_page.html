With eSIM, you can quickly and easily transfer an existing mobile plan or get a new mobile plan, all digitally. You can even store multiple eSIMs on the same device and use two phone numbers at the same time. And it’s more secure — someone can’t remove the physical SIM card if your iPhone is lost or stolen. In just a few simple steps, you are ready to make calls, send messages and browse the web. Learn more about eSIM (opens in new window) . \niPhone Air is activated with an eSIM and does not support a physical SIM card. Use of an eSIM requires a network provider that supports eSIM and a wireless service plan. See your provider for details.

                                                    An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates the need for a physical SIM&nbsp;card. With eSIM, you can quickly and easily transfer an existing mobile plan or get a new mobile plan, all digitally. You can even store multiple eSIMs on the same device and use two phone numbers at the same&nbsp;time. And it’s more secure — someone can’t remove the physical SIM card if your iPhone is lost or stolen. In just a few simple steps, you are ready to make calls, send messages and browse the&nbsp;web. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212780" data-slot-name="faqSection" data-feature-name="Astro Link" data-display-name="AOS: support.apple.com/kb/HT212780" target="_blank">Learn more about eSIM<span class="visuallyhidden">&nbsp;(opens in new window)&nbsp;</span></a>.

iPhone&nbsp;Air is activated with an eSIM and does not support a physical&nbsp;SIM&nbsp;card. Use of an eSIM requires a network provider that supports eSIM and a wireless service&nbsp;plan.

Use of an eSIM requires a network provider that supports eSIM and a wireless service&nbsp;plan. With eSIM Provider Activation, supported network providers can assign an eSIM to your iPhone digitally. If your network provider supports eSIM Quick Transfer, you can transfer the SIM from your previous iPhone to your new iPhone without contacting your provider. Additionally, your network provider can provide you with a QR code or ask you to use their app to activate an&nbsp;eSIM. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212780" data-slot-name="faqSection" data-feature-name="Astro Link" data-display-name="AOS: support.apple.com/kb/HT212780" target="_blank">Learn more about setting up your&nbsp;eSIM<span class="a11y"> (opens in new window)</span></a>.</p>
